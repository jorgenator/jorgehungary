                The majority of the renewable energy technologies involve electromechanical energy 
                conversion. When we talk about renewable energy we can also throw into the conversation
                energy storage, that is the capture of energy produced at one time for use at a later 
                time to reduce imbalances between energy demand and energy production. All these topics are 
                becoming of major importance due to their positive economic consequences on the gloal economy
                and on development. Having had the opportunity of working with a company that promotes sustainable
                energy solutions — <a href="https://bigbattery.com/">Big Battery</a> — I have set out myself to 
                acquire the necessary knowledge to serve as a professional in this field, to improve growth and 
                education in my homeland Panama.

                Energy Storage is perhaps the most versatile asset available today to 
                modernize and decarbonize the electricity grid. If energy storage is the great enabler of the 
                clean energy transition, then software is the great enabler of energy storage, because it is 
                what drives the systems to deliver their optimal value; and that is precisely where my 
                background lies: software, but I must acquire the interdisciplinary knowledge that I am lacking 
                to be able to confidently embark on this technology. That is the reason why I am decided to 
                go to study to Hungary, for its advantageous quality of education that prepares students with 
                knowledge of the latest technologies.

                Shipping containers housing is one of the projects that comprises many of the renewable energy techonologies
                I plan to study. My proposed solution consist of significantly contributing to the efforts for fostering the 
                “prosumers” energy culture  — someone who both produces and consumes energy —through 
                the implementation of Energy Decentralization projects such as battery backup solar panel 
                powered container houses that function as micro power plants to export power back to the 
                grid, wind generating units,  biomass generators and a long list of others initiatives that could 
                be carried out to benefit people in rural areas of every country.
                <br> <br>
                It's much cheaper to build a shipping container home than a regular home. While a single container home might 
                cost around $30,000 to build, a house of similar size would cost you around $90,000 to build. This might be 
                a great alternative for those people who live in areas so remote that the power supply is very poor.

                La Chorrera is the place where I came of age, located in the province of Panama Oeste, Panama. Every year
                thousands of people set their eyes on La Chorrera as one of the few opportunities to have the house of their 
                dreams, because the cost of housing is significantly cheaper compared to that of the city; but with this, 
                the district grows in a disorderly manner and without a real development. Due to this problem, we have several 
                communities that can not get access to basics needs such as: electricity, water, education, public transportation
                and health care. By carrying out these projects, we will catalyze innovation and accelerate progress, procuring 
                always these solutions to be open source.
