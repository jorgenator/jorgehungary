            <h1>A language platform dedicated to assisting students learning Hungarian</h1>            
            <img src="resources/hungarian-found-group.jpg" alt="languagePlatform.jpg">
            <h2>My Beginnings</h2>
            <p>
                During my first days studying the Hungarian language, I knew it was going to be a great challenge. Hungarian, completely different from my native language, Spanish, presented numerous obstacles. Fortunately, I had excellent teachers who structured the classes in a comprehensible way, allowing me to gradually assimilate the language. However, although classes were fundamental for understanding grammar and getting vocabulary, I discovered that a significant part of language learning lies in <b>repetition and memory</b>. This became evident when studying vocabulary, verb conjugations, grammar rules, among others.                
            </p> 
            <br>      
            <p>
                I began my studies in a group with the most basic level of Hungarian. Key concepts, such as word order, emphasis, grammatical cases, and possessive suffixes, were completely unknown to us. Such topics take time to make sense in one's head, but since it was an intensive course, we lacked the opportunity to practice thoroughly until achieving a complete understanding of each subject. This is why we failed when trying to use what we had learned in conversations or writing in the language.
            </p>
            <h2>The problem</h2>
            <p>
                One of the most evident challenges was the inflection of both verbs and nouns. Remembering so many suffixes requires a lot of repetition and memorization.</p>
            </p>
            <img src="resources/joke-conjugation.png" alt="joke-pastConjg.jpg">
            <p>  
                But how was this reality addressed in the classroom? Consulting with my classmates, some found it better to read the conjugation table of a verb and try to recite it from memory; others found it more practical to write everything down. And finally, there were others who simply didn't memorize or repeat, but relied on memorizing through daily use. Due to our poor performance, our teachers constantly gave us tests to memorize vocabulary, inflections, and understand grammar rules. It was evident that there was a lack of effort on the part of the class, as we felt overwhelmed with so much information. But in the end, the reality was that if we wanted to improve, in addition to the 4 hours of daily classes, we had to study extra hours at home.
            <p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Speaking personally with the teachers, I realized that this year has been the least productive for the Hungarian Foundations program. In recent years, there were few tests that the teachers had to give due to poor student performance, there was also little need to delay topics in the curriculum due to lack of retention by students, and above all, there were not as many incidents of absenteeism from class.
            </p>
            <h2>How I faced this challange with technology</h2>
            <p>
                Since I knew I had a lot of study and repetition to do outside of class, I knew the best way to face this was by using technology. Instead of writing and rewriting all verbs with their conjugations in my notebook, I did it on a spreadsheet using a function to randomly generate verbs extracted from my word database. Instead of memorizing extensive lists of verbs by reading them from a page or book, I did all the memorization with the spaced repetition system of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anki_(software)">Anki</a>. Instead of reading texts in books and marking unfamiliar words with a pencil, I learned to use <a href="https://luteorg.github.io/lute-manual/background.html">Lute</a>, and to take notes in class and keep track of them, I learned to use <a href="https://www.reliancedigital.in/solutionbox/obsidian-second-brain-and-note-taking-solution/">Obsidian</a>. All of the mentioned tools are <b>open source that anyone can use</b>, but perhaps the process of installing, learning, and using them may not be as attractive compared to traditional methods.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                As the classes went by, I realized that if my group and I wanted to improve my Hungarian, in addition to expanding our vocabulary, we had to master the following:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Indefinite and definite verb conjugations.</li>
                <li>Possession and noun inflection.</li>
                <li>Verb arguments.</li>
                <li>Word order.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <p>
                These concepts are the ones that must be confronted the most by memorizing them, rather than trying to find logic or similarity with other languages. There's no other way; we just have to memorize them.
            </p>
            <h2>My Study Method</h2>
            <h3>1. Acquiring vocabulary</h3>
            <br>
            <h4>1.1. In class</h4>
            <br>

                <div>
                    <p>
                        Every day, I use Obsidian to jot down all the words, phrases, and grammar rules we cover in class. I also utilize it during practice sessions with friends and teachers. I appreciate Obsidian because it fosters the creation of a knowledge network through <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Backlinks">backlinks</a>. If you're organized enough, you can access ideas, notes, and anything you've done months ago by sectioning everything with headings and tags. It boasts a powerful search tool.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        There are people I've seen with millions of notes, especially those who dedicate themselves to writing stories or conducting research. Every day, they open a new note and jot down all their thoughts or excerpts from books or web pages they come across. Obsidian shines in these types of situations; we can keep a record of our progress and access those thoughts we wrote in it.

                    <span>This is a video I recorded showing the save feature of Google Translate Mobile, very useful to save any types of texts with their translation</span>
                </div> 
                <br>
                <p>Beyond the classroom, I'm constantly exposed to words. On Google Translate mobile, there's an option that lets you save all the words you translate. It's represented by a star-shaped button in the upper right corner. So, whenever I'm out and about and see a sign, an advertisement, or even hear something I don't understand in Hungarian, since it's a phonetic language, I can write them down as they sound and get their translation. Once I'm home, Google Translate Web allows me to access my saved words and phrases from the day, along with their translations into English or any preferred language. It also allows me to export them to a spreadsheet, which is very useful for adding them all to Anki and studying them later.                </p>               
                <br>
                <iframe width="100%" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gm2wqjyn1P4" title="exporting saved gtranslate words to Anki" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                    <span>This is a video showing how I transfer all the words saved in Google Translate to Anki. I used an empty deck so that I does not affect my current database</span>

            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>2. Retaining vocabulary</h2>
                <p>Once I acquire vocabulary, it's time to retain it. In my opinion, and according to many linguists, the best way to do this is through spaced repetition. Anki has a powerful algorithm known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperMemo#:~:text=released%20in%202019.-,Description%20of%20SM%2D2%20algorithm,last%20time%20it%20was%20not.">SM-2</a>, but a second one known as FSRS was recently added in version 23.10, which, although a bit more complex than the former, is intended for more efficient results with less effort. That's precisely why I use <a href="https://medium.com/@JarrettYe/how-to-use-the-next-generation-spaced-repetition-algorithm-fsrs-on-anki-5a591ca562e2">FSRS</a>. In Anki, I have the entire database of words I've encountered in class or learned on my own. I also have it on my phone, both in the mobile version of Anki and in a Google Sheets document.</p>

                <div class="span-container">
                    <span>In its original form, Anki provides a straightforward platform for studying vocabulary</span>
                </div> 
                <br>
                <p>Anki might be a bit confusing at first, and it's not the most visually appealing app out there. There are alternatives with better user experience, such as Memrise, Quizlet, Brainscape, etc. However, Anki is undoubtedly the most customizable tool available. In my case, I prefer writing the answers rather than just seeing them and pressing a button. Fortunately, Anki allows you to adjust the cards to your preferences, as they are presented using HTML. That's why we can add audio, images, links, etc. As for the interface not being visually attractive, if we know CSS, we can modify the appearance and even rearrange the fields of the card since, by default, they are ordered vertically like any other HTML document.
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>In my case, I wrote CSS code to stylize my cards in Anki, and I installed plugins to add audio and GIFs to enhance memory and also to hear the pronunciation of words.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>3. Not everything is vocabulary</h2>
                <p>After 7 months of following this methodology, I've amassed a good number of words and phrases, 3000 to be precise, which I keep fresh in my memory thanks to tools like Anki. But not everything is about vocabulary; there are also concepts <b>I need to memorize, especially those 4 points I mentioned earlier: verb conjugations, possessive inflections of nouns, verb arguments, and word order</b>. What I have come up with, as an alternative to traditional studying method like writing in paper, is the use of a spreadsheet that has a copy of my words database in anki and the vast database of Wiktionary.</p>
                <br>
                <p>With the aid of aforementioned tools such as Anki, Google Sheets, Wiktionary and a bit of coding, I can streamline repetitive tasks to aid in memorization. Here's a video demonstrating this solution:
                </p>
                <br>
                <iframe width="100%" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/opuoxujXGp8" title="Walkthrough of my solution" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <br> <br>
                <p>It's possible that this methodology might not be the most straightforward for individuals who aren't highly proficient in computer usage and programming. Additionally, we observe that we have multiple windows open, which could potentially hinder the experience, especially on computers with lower specifications. This fragmentation of tasks across various applications may lead to a less seamless workflow.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Therefore, in an ideal scenario, we would hope to discover a platform that consolidates the functionalities of each program we utilize. Such a unified platform would not only simplify the user experience but also optimize system resources, ensuring smoother performance even on less powerful hardware configurations.

                <div>
                    <h3>Language Drills</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>In an <a href="https://www.bell-foundation.org.uk/eal-programme/guidance/classroom-guidance/great-ideas/language-drills/#:~:text=What%20are%20language%20drills%3F,introduced%20in%20a%20curriculum%20context.">article</a> published by The Bell Foundation, language drills are identified as a strategic technique for encoding language segments through repetitive practice.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><span class="apos">"</span> Language drills are a way of memorising a chunk of language by repeating it. They can be a very effective approach for learning new vocabulary or language structures. Through drilling, learners internalise the target language and are more likely to be able to produce it independently in the future, both in speech and writing.<span class="apos">"</span></p>
                    <br>
                    <p><span class="apos">"</span> Language drills are useful because they give EAL learners an opportunity to hear and practise key language structures. Crucially they involve repetition of target language, which research shows is important to learning new vocabulary.<span class="apos">"</span> </p>
                    <br>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>What will this app consist of?</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Based on the concept of Language Drills, my proposal, Dri-L Magyar, is designed to serve as a comprehensive aid tool built upon the study system I developed using multiple separate applications. Instead of having to navigate through various apps, Dri-L Magyar aims to integrate these functionalities into a single platform, streamlining the process for students. They won't need to configure everything from scratch as I did.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Unfortunately, Hungarian, being a difficult and less popular language compared to French or English, lacks sufficient learning resources. While platforms like Duolingo exist online, offering structured courses with scoring systems for learning Hungarian, they cater more to beginners. However, for those seeking applications to practice conjugations, noun inflections, and other advanced aspects, the options are limited. It's precisely these individuals who will benefit from my proposal.                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <br>
                    <h3>How will it work? </h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>In the early stages of the project, I plan to develop a tool for practicing verb conjugations and possessive noun inflections. This will be achieved through the utilization of the Wiktionary API integrated into a web platform. Using the Wiktionary API in a web program involves making HTTP requests to the Wiktionary server to fetch information about words, definitions, translations, and more.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>During this phase, users will have the ability to import their own word lists database in CSV or TSV format directly onto the website and randomize prompts for the words they want to conjugate. I will use JavaScript to handle file input and parsing.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If the user chooses not to use or lacks a sufficiently large word list, they can opt to generate random words from the Wiktionary database. For the early stages of the project, we will consider implementing the option to filter words based on their difficulty level (A1, A2, B2, etc.).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Moving forward, I aim to integrate the ability to search for relevant information such as verb complements, possessive forms of nouns, and determining the corresponding stative locative case (suppressive or inessive), among other features.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Depending on whether I have any kind of assistance in financing a dedicated database, I could make the application more comprehensive by incorporating reading tools like Lute and flashcards like Anki. If this is not feasible, I could consider developing it as a web application with a local server using Python Flask and MySQL.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Finally, I also aim to establish a community that can share knowledge on any other available tools that are equally beneficial. Also enable the opportunity for users to share word lists similar to <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks">Anki shared decks</a>, exchange reading practice texts as seen on <a href="https://languagecrush.com/">LanguageCrush</a>, and welcome any other potential additions for consideration in the future.                    </p>
