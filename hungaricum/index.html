            <h1>A language platform dedicated to assisting students learning Hungarian</h1>            
            <img src="resources/hungarian-found-group.jpg" alt="languagePlatform.jpg">
            <h2>My Beginnings</h2>
            <p>
                During my first days studying the Hungarian language, I knew it was going to be a great challenge. Hungarian, completely different from my native language, Spanish, presented numerous obstacles. Fortunately, I had excellent teachers who structured the classes in a comprehensible way, allowing me to gradually assimilate the language. However, although classes were fundamental for understanding grammar and getting vocabulary, I discovered that a significant part of language learning lies in <b>repetition and memory</b>. This became evident when studying vocabulary, verb conjugations, grammar rules, among others.                
            </p> 
            <br>      
            <p>
                I began my studies in a group with the most basic level of Hungarian. Key concepts, such as word order, emphasis, grammatical cases, and possessive suffixes, were completely unknown to us. Such topics take time to make sense in one's head, but since it was an intensive course, we lacked the opportunity to practice thoroughly until achieving a complete understanding of each subject. This is why we failed when trying to use what we had learned in conversations or writing in the language.
            </p>
            <h2>The problem</h2>
            <p>
                One of the most evident challenges was the inflection of both verbs and nouns. Remembering so many suffixes requires a lot of repetition and memorization.</p>
            </p>
            <img src="resources/joke-conjugation.png" alt="joke-pastConjg.jpg">
            <p>  
                But how was this reality addressed in the classroom? Consulting with my classmates, some found it better to read the conjugation table of a verb and try to recite it from memory; others found it more practical to write everything down. And finally, there were others who simply didn't memorize or repeat, but relied on memorizing through daily use. Due to our poor performance, our teachers constantly gave us tests to memorize vocabulary, inflections, and understand grammar rules. It was evident that there was a lack of effort on the part of the class, as we felt overwhelmed with so much information. But in the end, the reality was that if we wanted to improve, in addition to the 4 hours of daily classes, we had to study extra hours at home.
            <p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Speaking personally with the teachers, I realized that this year has been the least productive for the Hungarian Foundations program. In recent years, there were few tests that the teachers had to give due to poor student performance, there was also little need to delay topics in the curriculum due to lack of retention by students, and above all, there were not as many incidents of absenteeism from class.
            </p>
            <h2>How I faced this challange with technology</h2>
            <p>
                Since I knew I had a lot of study and repetition to do outside of class, I knew the best way to face this was by using technology. Instead of writing and rewriting all verbs with their conjugations in my notebook, I did it on a spreadsheet using a function to randomly generate verbs extracted from my word database. Instead of memorizing extensive lists of verbs by reading them from a page or book, I did all the memorization with the spaced repetition system of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anki_(software)">Anki</a>. Instead of reading texts in books and marking unfamiliar words with a pencil, I learned to use <a href="https://luteorg.github.io/lute-manual/background.html">Lute</a>, and to take notes in class and keep track of them, I learned to use <a href="https://www.reliancedigital.in/solutionbox/obsidian-second-brain-and-note-taking-solution/">Obsidian</a>. All of the mentioned tools are <b>open source that anyone can use</b>, but perhaps the process of installing, learning, and using them may not be as attractive compared to traditional methods.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                As the classes went by, I realized that if my group and I wanted to improve my Hungarian, in addition to expanding our vocabulary, we had to master the following:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Infinitive and definitive verb conjugations.</li>
                <li>Possession and noun inflection.</li>
                <li>Verb arguments.</li>
                <li>Word order.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <p>
                These concepts are the ones that must be confronted the most by memorizing them, rather than trying to find logic or similarity with other languages. There's no other way; we just have to memorize them.
            </p>

                        Every day, I use Obsidian to jot down all the words, phrases, and grammar rules we cover in class. I also utilize it during practice sessions with friends and teachers. I appreciate Obsidian because it fosters the creation of a knowledge network through <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Backlinks">backlinks</a>. If you're organized enough, you can access ideas, notes, and anything you've done months ago by sectioning everything with headings and tags. It boasts a powerful search tool.

                        There are people I've seen with millions of notes, especially those who dedicate themselves to writing stories or conducting research. Every day, they open a new note and jot down all their thoughts or excerpts from books or web pages they come across. Obsidian shines in these types of situations; we can keep a record of our progress and access those rules or words we wrote in it.

                <br>
                <p>Beyond the classroom, I'm constantly exposed to words. On Google Translate mobile, there's an option that lets you save all the words you translate. It's represented by a star-shaped button in the upper right corner. So, whenever I'm out and about and see a sign, an advertisement, or even hear something I don't understand in Hungarian, since it's a phonetic language, I can write them down as they sound and get their translation. Once I'm home, Google Translate Web allows me to access my saved words and phrases from the day, along with their translations into English or any preferred language. It also allows me to export them to a spreadsheet, which is very useful for adding them all to Anki and studying them later.                </p>
