                I am a graduating student with a track
                record of meeting objectives,
                utilizing organized and consistent
                practices; able to manage multiple
                priorities with a positive attitude and
                willing to help by offering excellent
                communication and good judgment.
                <br> <br>
                I am a big fan of technology, learning languages,
                music and combat sports. I have taken up coding 
                more actively the last few months since it is a powerful 
                tool to exploit my imagination. I also love spending my 
                free time learning about different cultures and how they 
                impact the way we think and the way we communicate. 
                <br> <br>
                I have always dreamed with going abroad to study. I really 
                believe in the importance of helping my country improve and 
                grow. The more the time passes by, the clearer I see how 
                to contribute to my country's quality of life.
