            <h1>My experience at JIC 2020</h1>
            <p>
                The JIC 2020 taught me a number of lessons that I continue to use to this day. Most people participate in research projects or prototype design projects, but my team and I decided to do both. Despite the daunting challenge, the results were greatly satisfying.

                The Jornada de Iniciación Científica (JIC) is an initiative of the Universidad Tecnológica de Panamá that aims to encourage research among young
                undergraduate students at the national level.
                <br> <br>
                In 2020 due to the recent COVID-19 breakout, the University decided to conduct the event virtually. 
                A new venture for the University, but everyone was willing to take on the challenge
                <br> <br>
                My friends — who will later become my research team — and I, were in our third year at the time. <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> and <strong>Investigation Methodology</strong> were two of the subjects we were taking</strong>,                
                and a final project was required for each of these subjects in order to pass.    
                <br> <br>
                As we were building our projects throughout the semester, our professors advised us to join the 
                JIC. They believed that our projects had the potential to make it to the finals and compete for the winner prize
                so we picked up the courage and set out to undertake the challenge. 
                <br> <br> 
                We already had two projects that we were working on so we needed to pick one to submit it to the JIC and participate.
                We were quite undecided as to the best project of the two. Until one meeting where we said not so seriosly: <strong>"Why don't we participate with both projects?"</strong>
                We laughed at the comment, it was going to be very difficult to participate with two projects simultaneously.
                <br> <br>
                However, after a not so thorough examination, we decided to step up for the challenge. We figured that
                if the JIC that year was going to be conducted virtually, it was entirely possible that we would
                have the time to present both projects, moreover, we did not know if we were going to be the first students
                ever who would do such thing, so we were pretty excited to have that as a personal achievement.  
            </p>

                    We made the prototype with cheap devices to demonstrate that anybody could
                    provide a solution to a problem with the help of technology.

                The two projects we participated with were: <strong>"Intelligent Communicator and Alarm for people with motor impairments"</strong> and 
                <strong>"Influence of stress, anxiety and depression on the performance of university students in La Chorrera"</strong>.
                <br> <br>
                We made it through the first round where we competed with other research groups in our class.
                Then we passed the second round where we competed with students from the same Regional Center, in 
                our case UTP La Chorrera. Then a few days later we were notified that we made it to the finals. We 
                were extremely excited that we had gotten so far. But unfortunatelly, just one of our projects made it,
                which was <strong>"Intelligent Communicator and Alarm for people with motor impairments"</strong>.
                <br> <br>
                Although it was the project were we felt most comfortable, we really wanted to get some feedback and 
                take in some reactions on the topic we covered with our second project. The project really resonated with
                some of our classmates and we wanted to give the message to the University Leaders, that mental health is very important
                in student's performance, especially in times of pandemic. 
                <br> <br> 
                Some days later, we gave our last presentation at the finals but unfortunatelly we did not win first place.
                Although we did not win, we felt relieved that everything was over. It had been days sleep deprivation and coffee drinking that had 
                finally came to an end. 
                <br> <br>
                We most certainly learned many things during the contest. We improved our cientific method and we had 
                extra points at class for taking the challange. I very much look forward to participate at the JIC in the 
                near future, this time with a better structured project that could potentially steal the attention of 
                investors interested in helping the country grow. But until then, I still have some learning to do.
