            <p>
                Here is a compilation of videos of some of the projects I did during my undergraduate studies
                at Techonological University of Panama:

                    This was a project where I developed a voice-controlled intelligent assistant like Google Assistant using
                    python for my AI class. I was able to integrate an API to my code that allowed me to send a WhatsApp message using my voice.
                    Another feature that it had was searching on the Google Search Engine using voice commands in both Spanish and English.

                    In the Software Engineering course, we were assigned to find a company to work with, and try to 
                    come up with a solution to any technological problem the company may have. I got in contact with 
                    Cementos Argos and I created the design and project planning for the implementation of a software capable of automating
                    the work order process within the cement plant.

                    I still remember when I pulled a whole nighter for this game to be finished before 9:00 am next morning. 
                    Me and my friends were talking on Discord, waking each other up, trying to make the game work before collapsing 
                    due to sleep deprivation. We successfully made our first game using C++ & Unity, Photoshop, Inkscape, etc., all 
                    the animation design and game coding skills that we learned throughout the whole course were put to the test with this final project.
