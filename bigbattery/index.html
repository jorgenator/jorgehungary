            <h1>My admission to Big Battery</h1>
            <p>
                On December 27th 2022, I started as an Intern Engineer at <a href="https://bigbattery.com/">Big Battery</a> Panama.   
                The company has just started and I was one of the two first Interns that were
                picked out to help the company grow.

                Big Battery is a cost-effective energy solutions company which purpose is to promote mass adoption of renewable energy or also 
                known as Green Energy. The last mentioned is important for the environment as it <strong>replaces the negative effects of fossil fuels</strong> with 
                more environmentally-friendly alternatives.
                <br> <br>
                Being part of this company has allowed me to appreciate firsthand the potential that renewable energy holds and see how close we are to seeing change
                in our country thanks to companies like Big Battery, which is interested in helping other countries join the green energy revolution.
